## Overview

Regression analysis is a fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationship between multiple variables. It is a very flexible tool that can be used to address a range of research questions. This course builds on the Beginnerâ€™s Regression workshop where you will learn how to use regression models with R to model complex, multi-dimensional datasets and make more nuanced comparisons. 

## Course objectives

By the end of the session you will be able to:

* Use regression answer to answer a wide range of research questions
* Fit a regression model with interactions between predictor variables 
* Fit multi-level regression models 
* Extract and summarise the results from a range of regression models
* Design a regression model appropriate for addressing their specific research question



## Pre-requisite knowledge

Learners are expected to already be familiar with 

* the basics of R, such as how to load a dataset from a local file and manipulate variables
* simple regression models, including linear regression, logistic regression and multiple regression. 

## Workshop format

This a hybrid workshop run over 1 sessions. The [schedule can be found here](https://coding-for-reproducible-research.github.io/advanced-regression-with-r/schedule.html).
